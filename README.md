## Get Started

Follow these steps to set up and run your React Native project with our template:

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**
- **[Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)**
- **[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)** (for iOS development)

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

Clone the template repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Shenggg2000/app-template.git
```

### **Step 2: Navigate to the Project Folder**

Move into the project folder using the following command:

```bash
cd app-template
```

### **Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**

Before proceeding, configure your environment variables for each SDLC phase by following these steps:

1. In the root directory of your project, locate the following files:
    - **`.env.example.dev`**
    - **`.env.example.qa`**
    - **`.env.example.uat`**
    - **`.env.example.prod`**
2. Rename these files as follows:
    - **`.env.dev`**
    - **`.env.qa`**
    - **`.env.uat`**
    - **`.env.prod`**
3. Open each of the renamed **`.env`** files (**`.env.dev`**, **`.env.qa`**, **`.env.uat`**, **`.env.prod`**) and provide the specific environment variables and values relevant to each SDLC phase.

### **Step 4: Install Dependencies**

Install project dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### **Step 5: Rename the App**

Use the following command to rename the app to your preferred name. Replace **`"yourappname"`** with your desired app name:

```bash
npx react-native-rename "yourappname" --skipGitStatusCheck
```

### **Step 6 (Optional): Update App Name (If Needed)**

If you want the app name to include the environment name, follow these steps:

******iOS******

- Navigate to **`ios/yourappname/Info.plist`**.
- Update **CFBundleDisplayName** in line 8 from:

```xml
<key>CFBundleDisplayName</key>
<string>yourappname</string>
```

to:

```xml
<key>CFBundleDisplayName</key>
<string>${APP_NAME}</string>
```

**************Android**************

- Navigate to **`android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`**.
- Update **app_name** in line 2 from:

```xml
<string name="app_name">yourappname</string>
```

to:

```xml
<string name="app_name">@string/APP_NAME</string>
```

This step is optional and should only be performed if you want to include the environment name in your app's display name.

### **Step 7: Install Pod Dependencies**

Install pod dependencies for iOS by running:

```bash
npx pod-install ios
```

### **Step 8: Start Metro Server**

Start the Metro server by running:

```bash
yarn run start
```

### **Step 9: Build and Run the App**

Open another terminal window and build the project in the development environment:

```bash
yarn run ios
```

Now, your React Native project is up and running with the configured environment settings. Happy coding!

## Customize Font

Enhance the visual appeal of your React Native project by adding custom fonts. Follow these steps to integrate your preferred font family into the template:

### **Step 1: Download Font Family**

Download your preferred font family from Google Fonts or other font providers. Ensure that you have the necessary .ttf font files.

### **Step 2: Replace Default Fonts**

Navigate to the **`assets/fonts`** directory in your project and replace the default .ttf files with your downloaded font family .ttf files.

### **Step 3: Link Font Assets**

Open your terminal in the root directory of your project and run the following command to link the font assets:

```bash
npx react-native-asset
```

### **Step 4: Configure Fonts for iOS**

For iOS, follow these additional steps:

- Open Xcode and navigate to your project's **`ios`** folder.
- In Xcode, select all the font .ttf files that you placed in the **`assets/fonts`** directory under the "Resources" folder.
- In the right panel, tick the checkbox for all four targets to ensure that the fonts are included in the build.
